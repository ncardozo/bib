                  RELEASeD Bibliographic Repository

This directory contains BibTeX files for different domains, the most
important of which is of course computer science (compsci.bib).

Further subdividing compsci.bib is worthless.  There will always be
references that belong to two or three different domains at the same
time, for example AOP, OOP, language engineering and software
engineering.  So we have just one big file with everything.

Note that you are not forced to use one BibTeX database at a time.
For instance, you can have a local.bib file with your own very
specific entries, and include both your local database and some of the
laboratory-wide ones:

    \bibliography{local,bib/general,bib/compsci}

This example supposes that you checked out the bibliographic
repository into a directory called 'bib'.


Repository etiquette
====================

Much as Java, Smalltalk or any other kind of code, the BibTeX files
follow certain formatting conventions.

  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
> Please respect the formatting conventions of BibTeX files <
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These conventions are described in the STYLE file.  Take the time to
edit the entries you add by hand so that they follow the same
formatting as existing ones.  If you are short of time, simply defer
your contribution to a point in which you will be able to properly
format your entries, for instance by placing it in your local.bib
database.
