                    BibTeX Formatting Conventions

The ACM Digital Library follows many of the following conventions.
Hence, most of the time you can simply copy-paste the entries from
their website, retouching them slightly.

- For the key, use the first author family name, a plus sign if there
  is more than one, the two digits of the year, and then the most
  important keyword, acronym or abbreviation of the paper.  Examples:

  foote+05multimethods
  weiser91ubicomp
  kay93history

  This helps knowing the paper to which the key refers, without
  looking it up in the database.

- Use {braces} instead of "double quotes" to enclose data.

- You don't need to enclose numbers in braces.  For example, instead of

  volume ={3586},

  write instead

  volume = 3586,

- Use as many of the definitions in general.bib as possible.  For
  instance, don't write

    series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science},

  but write instead

    series = series-lncs,

  You can add new entries to general.bib for any item that will be
  used more than once.

  Similarly, prefer BibTeX's predefined month shortcuts. Rather than

  month = {September}

  write instead

  month = sep

- Use lowercase for entry types and keys.  For example, avoid

  @InProceedings{fjn05multi,

  or

  @INPROCEEDINGS{fjn05multi,

  write instead

  @inproceedings{fjn05multi,

  The same holds for keys.  Avoid

  Year = 2005,

  or

  YEAR = 2005,

  and write instead

  year = 2005,

- Separate page ranges with an en dash, instead of a single dash, as in

  pages = {693--696},

- If available, encode the DOI of your entries, since they can be
  hyperlinked with hyperref.  Use the following format:

  doi = {10.1145/960112.28718},

- If available, encode the ISSN or ISBN of your entries.  They are
  used by the natbib package.

- Encode full author names rather than initials. Instead of

  author = {B. Foote and R. Johnson and J. Noble}

  rather encode

  author = {Brian Foote and Ralph E. Johnson and James Noble}.
